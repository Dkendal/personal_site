            I make computers do things. I currently live in beautiful Victoria,
            British Columbia Canada. I graduated from Okanagan College with a
            Computer Information Systems diploma and I'm finishing my Bachelor
            of Science at the University of Victoria this year. I've been
            building things all my life, from Lego to logistics systems.
